Words are learned in their natural context, making them more memorable and easier to understand.

The extension tracks learned words and gradually reduces their translation frequency.

### Progressive Difficulty
Start with light translation intensity and increase as you become more comfortable.

### Immersive Experience
Learning happens naturally during your regular browsing, without dedicated study time.
