## üéØ Translation Methodology

WordWeave uses intelligent translation principles:

### Contextual Translation
Words are translated in their natural context, preserving the original language structure while making content more accessible.

### Percentage-Based Approach
Instead of translating everything, WordWeave translates a configurable percentage of words, allowing users to:
- Maintain exposure to the original language
- Gradually increase comprehension
- Customize difficulty level

### Smart Word Selection
The extension intelligently selects words for translation based on:
- Word frequency and importance
- Content type (headers, body text, navigation)
- User-defined translation intensity

## üîß Development

### Prerequisites
- Firefox Developer Edition (recommended)
- Node.js (for development tools)
- Basic knowledge of WebExtensions API

### Setup
